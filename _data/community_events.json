What continues to surprise him is the misconceptions that surface again and again about which teams should use these technologies and where they can benefit from them. David will debunk some of those myths and give us all a clearer picture on their usefulness and how and where we should be using them.\"\n\n7.00pm - Break\n7.15pm - TALK #2 \"DevSecOps with GitLab: How to embed Security within the Software Delivery Process\" with Stefania Chaplin\n\n\"Implementing DevOps can drastically improve the rate we deliver software. Organisations can go from deploying changes a few times a year to multiple times a day. What about vulnerabilities? Security is often considered an afterthought and this can have dire consequences as the world becomes increasingly reliant on software. How do we embed security into the software delivery process? Security is a quality check, there are multiple types and we need to make the software delivery experience as smooth as possible.In this session, you'll find out more about common pain points, solutions, and how to embed security within the software delivery process and secure your DevOps process.\"\n\n7.45pm - Questions/Any Other Business\n8.00pm - Close\n\n***\n\nNathan + Jim"

        "description": "Short Description:\nWe talk a lot about DevSecOps, but what do we really mean when we say that? Nobody really can agree on what it means, and if you listen to vendors it's just security tools embedded in your CI/CD processes. I believe in the original idea of a group of people with backgrounds in development, security, and operations working collaboratively together to build and deploy better, more secure applications. Based on that vision I wrote the DevSecOps Playbook in early 2022 as a list of specific steps that people from all three domains (dev, sec, and ops) can do together. The Playbook is 60 tasks that DevSecOps teams can perform to materially affect their application environments. This presentation will walk the audience through all 55 tasks in the Playbook and show them how to prioritize the tasks for their specific company based on the resources that org has.\n\nLonger Description:\nWhat is DevSecOps? How do I \"do\" it? There's a lot of hype around DevSecOps right now, and getting two people to agree on exactly what it means can be a challenge. Unfortunately, there's a lot of vendor narrative that says it's CI/CD with some security thrown in for good measure, but DevSecOps is a lot more than that! My career was changed by the DevOps movement and I believe that DevSecOps should be built on top of DevOps. What does that mean? Well, what made DevOps so powerful for me in the late 2000's was that it brought together people from different departments to work together. Developers learned more about how to manage the underlying infrastructure, and ops teams learned how to use code to build and manage automation. This was powerful and I believe we can do the same with DevSecOps: bring security teams into the processes and workflows that DevOps built at at the same time those security teams will evolve to understand how operations and development teams work.\nThis talk will cover my DevSecOps Playbook which is an open source step-by-step guide to implementing DevSecOps for any organization. This Playbook is broken down into 5 distinct areas of domain expertise:\nDevelopment Environment\nSource Code Management\nContinuous Integration / Deployment and other Automation\nDeployment Environments\nOrganizational Functions\nThe DevSecOps Playbooks spreads the controls evenly across these 5 domains and highlights that this is a group responsibility. There is also an addendum for compliance frameworks and how they can map to the tasks and controls listed in the Playbook. In this talk I will outline these 5 areas and talk about the different controls and tasks in each. I will also give examples of how to implement a subset of these controls.\n\nLocation of this event coming soon."

Now... Did you ever stop to wonder why? Why are there still supply chain issues with production code, why does phishing still work, why are machines not being patched, why is it that not everything mission critical is protected with 2FA, and why is it seemingly so hard to inventory systems? But this talk actually isn\u2019t about the \"why\", it\u2019s about the \"what\": What we can do to identify and address the root causes and how we can positively influence our own security program. During this presentation we'll take a realistic view into human nature, technical & non-technical controls, and have a conversation about change... for the better."

We use it when checking our bank statements, buying pig plushies online, or sending stickers to each other on instant messengers. Given its ubiquity, it is, for the most part, taken for granted by developers: import HTTP/crypto/TLS, throw in a certificate from Let's Encrypt, and don't think much about it while relying on (hopefully) safe defaults.\nWhile sticking with well-vetted libraries should work out of the box for most cases, in certain areas, you need to be a bit more knowledgeable, if only to make good decisions about what libraries to use and how to wrangle all the moving parts into a cohesive and secure system.\nCryptography tends to be full of obscure notation that isn't that dissimilar to magic spells, and \"Don't Roll Your Own Crypto\" is an often repeated mantra (many times because of the previous statement). Search results for \"crypto\" have been getting progressively more complicated to navigate, with BTC, XRP, and others taking up all the prime SEO result space.\nThis talk targets a beginner to an intermediate audience and, starting from a brief overview of core tenets (Kerckhoffs's principle, Schneier's Law, the economy of mechanism, theoretical vs. practical security), will expand upon the current challenges and trends in modern cryptography, from FHE to PQC (including explaining what those are), and also highlight common design pitfalls (and their consequences) and how to reduce your snake oil intake.\n\nBio:\nAn opinionated individual with interest in cryptography and its intersection with secure software development.\n\nLinkedIn: [https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/](https://www.linkedin.com/in/0xdsousa/)"

Learn From Others in the DevOps and DevSecOps Communities\nLook to the DevOps community to help close your critical knowledge gaps.\n2. 2\\. Start With Your Container Security\nThe first step to building out the security of your DevOps toolchain starts with your container security.\n3. Institute Continuous Compliance\nDevSecOps is a platform for continuous compliance to protect your software supply chains against vulnerable packages and vulnerable configurations.\n4. Double Down on Automation\nWhile you may have already been experimenting with automation during your DevOps phase, it only becomes more integral once you throw the switch in by going DevSecOps. Go into your DevOps to DevSecOps transformation with an automation strategy that focuses on automating common developer and sysadmin tasks.\n5. Improve Your Monitoring and Analytics\nBuilding out a DevSecOps toolchain takes your monitoring and analytics options to a new level. Consider the fact that you should already collect and publish data from your toolchain and deliver reports to your project managers, developers, QA testers, and stakeholders outside your team. Commonly, DevOps reporting is still a work in progress for organizations. Use the introduction of new security tools into your toolchain as a chance to offer more granular and real-time security reporting into all parts of your DevSecOps toolchain.\n6. Implement Accessibility Assurance\nDepending on your organization\u2019s definition of compliance, the option is there to add accessibility compliance or Section 508 to your DevSecOps toolchain.\n\nThis hands-on training is reserver for 70% professional and 30% students.\n\nMandatory:\n\nGeneral Conditions in order to validate your participation to this event:\n\n1\\. Student must send University/Student ID\\, otherwise registration will be rejected\\.\n\n2.Professional must register company emails, otherwise registration will be rejected.\n\nRegistration only via EventBrite. We don't accept answer via meetup.\n\nPlease indicate your firstname, lastname, company name, a valid business email or school email (email like gmai, free, hotmail, outlook, etc are not accepted and registration will be cancelled).\n\nPlease register here:\nhttps://www.eventbrite.com/e/billets-devsecops-toolchain-transformation-374188276207"

What are the pitfalls and the solutions? How do we avoid that someone else\u2019s security issues become our security problems? And, by all means, let\u2019s learn how to be a bit lazy, and do better with less effort!\n*Bio:*\nCurrently working as Information Security Manager at Canon EMEA, Sebastian has been in IT and Security for over 20 years, covering a multitude of roles ranging from Developer, Security Architect, Auditor and Consultant, before moving into security governance and management, giving him a unique multi-faceted view on today\u2019s InfoSec challenges. He has led multiple security improvement programs and performed maturity assessments for a wide variety of organizations - while continuously asking himself:\"Could we do this in another way?\"\n\n**About containers and their escapes: understanding escape patterns and possibilities**\n*Abstract:*\nContainers have become one of the most common underlying infrastructure for microservice architectures. As such, they can often be part of the external attack surface of enterprise systems and applications (e.g., whenever a web application hosted on a kubernetes cluster is Internet-facing). Thus, it is important to understand what types of (mis)configurations can make containers more vulnerable against attacks of different types. In this talk, Mauricio will deep dive into different techniques that can be used to escape containers. In particular, he will talk about how to escape privileged containers, the usage of different capabilities, the usage of kernel exploits and a few other ways in which attackers may use to gain access to the hosts of the containers.\n*Bio:*\nMauricio Cano is a cloud pentester focused on container technologies. In particular, he focuses on the security of containers and serverless architectures. He has pentested Kubernetes clusters and serverless architectures for several multinational financial institutions. Prior to his security work, he has a background in academia and a Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Groningen, focused on programming language design and formal methods to ensure correctness. In his spare time, Cano enjoys reading, cooking, and solving puzzles."

In the Vipps app, for example, you just use biometrics (or a PIN code) and you're in with a blink of an eye! But how much work goes into creating such a system? What actually happens if someone steals my Vipps PIN code? And why doesn't Vipps just have a \"login with Facebook\" button? You'll get the answers to these questions in this presentation. We'll cover everything from the EU directive PSD2 to how to practically secure APIs so that the next time you log in to Vipps, you'll know what's happening behind the scenes!\n\nSpeaker: Nora Tomas is a developer and security lead for the User Security team at Vipps MobilePay.
